# TgiF
Demos of [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) applied to [astronomical spectroscopic data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy).

`T`emperature  
`g`ravity  
`i`nclination-projected rotational velocity  
[`F`e/H] and other abundance ratios


#### Getting started

TgiF requires these python libraries:  
- numpy
- pandas
- scipy
- jax

You can install a reproducible Python 3.7 development environment with all these dependencies and more with the provided `environment.yml` file and [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
